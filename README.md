ktime
=====

Not so simple timer, fun project while everyone in the speedrunning community is spiffying up their timers.

Opened repository since it can now handle splitting times correctly. Adding to approach feature parity
with wsplit and llanfair. Enjoy my terrible code as I attempt to write a semi-readable and maintainable
project. Hopefully this can provide inspiration on what (or what not) to do when implementing something like this.

UI implemented using JavaFX 2 because it seems to do everything swing should
have.
